# command

[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=godoc&message=reference&color=blue)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/creachadair/command)

This repository provides Go package that implements basic subcommand dispatch
for Go command-line programs. The design of this package is based on the way
the "go" command-line tool works, but the implementation is not shared.

This package is in a fairly early development state, and should be used with
caution.  Notably, there are no tests yet, and the API is likely to change in
various incompatible ways.
